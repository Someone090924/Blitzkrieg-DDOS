# Blitzkrieg DDOS v1.0

Welcome to Blitzkrieg DDOS v1.0! This is a simple script created for educational purposes, demonstrating how to send repeated GET and POST requests to a URL.

## What is Blitzkrieg?
**Blitzkrieg** is a German term that literally means "lightning war" (blitz = lightning, krieg = war). It describes a military tactic emphasizing quick and sudden attacks, usually combining air and ground forces simultaneously to shock and destroy the enemy before they can effectively respond.

This tactic was famously used by Germany during World War II, particularly in the invasions of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. The strategy involves sudden and fast-moving attacks to exploit the element of surprise, disrupt communications, and quickly destroy enemy logistics and command centers.

In modern or technological contexts, the term blitzkrieg is often used metaphorically to describe a fast and devastating attack, such as a cyber attack or an aggressive marketing campaign.
